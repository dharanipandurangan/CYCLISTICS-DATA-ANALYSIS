# CYCLISTICS-DATA-ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION
We are working in database share by Cyclistic- a bike-share company in Chicago. We consider ourself as a junior data analyst in this project in their marketing analyst team .Our duty is to find the insights through the datas shared by them for the future company development.

As a data analyst we have to find the insight through the data, so I take sample data from March, April & May-2021.This project is mainly made to have an idea, how we can approach a data and how we can try to gain some useful key findings in order to apply the results as marketing strategy for company development.

## ABOUT THE COMPANY
IN 2016, Cyclistics launch a successful bike-share offereing. Since then, the program as grown toa fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked form one station and returned to anyother station in the system anytime. Until now, their marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to board consumer segments. 

One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes and annual memberships.customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual membership are Cyclistics members.

## NEED FOR ANALYSIS
The finance analysts have conducted that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic  attract more customers, Moreno-Director of marketing and our manager in this scenario believes that maximizing the number of annyal member will be key to future growth.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The key task assigned for us as a Junior Data Analyst is to find, how the annual members and casual rides use the cyclistic differntly .
