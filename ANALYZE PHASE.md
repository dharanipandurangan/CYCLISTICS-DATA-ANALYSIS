#### In this Analyze Phasse, we can look into the codeing part which is perfomred in R.

#### Guiding questions

    - How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?
    - Has your data been properly formatted?
    - What surprises did you discover in the data?
    - What trends or relationships did you find in the data?
    - How will these insights help answer your business questions?

#### Key tasks

    1. Aggregate your data so itâ€™s useful and accessible.
    2. Organize and format your data.
    3. Perform calculations
    4. Identify trends and relationships.

#### Deliverable

    - Here is a summary of the analysis of the Bike Share data from Jan, 2021 to March, 2021
    - The data cleaning has been performed in RStudio.
    - This analysis is for case study 1 from the Google Data Analytics Certificate (Cyclistic).

    

#### Enviroment setup in R:

    - Install required packages and library for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.


```{r Install Packages, include=FALSE}
